## TL;DR
This is a prototype of the SnorkelTurtle system, which uses weakly supervision framework (Snorkel) to label real-time streaming data.

## Quick Start
1. Install the necessary packages (Python 3 and pip are required).

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run it, we provide a sample demo in `main.py`
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
