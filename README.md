[![Sanity Check](https://github.com/t1u4n/snorkel-turtle-poc/actions/workflows/sanity-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/t1u4n/snorkel-turtle-poc/actions/workflows/sanity-check.yaml)

This a POC project of 2024 SP CS511 Advanced Data Management course project. The goal of this project is to build a real-time labeling system for streaming data using [Snorkel](https://www.snorkel.org/).

author: [tian23@illinois.edu](mailto:tian23@illinois.edu)

## TL;DR
This is a prototype of the SnorkelTurtle system, which uses weakly supervision framework (Snorkel) to label real-time streaming data.

## Quick Start
1. Install the necessary packages (Python 3 and pip are required).

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run it, we provide a sample demo in `main.py`
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
